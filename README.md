# Durable Functions with GitHub Repo and Key Vault Creation

This repository contains:
- Azure Durable Functions in PowerShell that:
  - Creates a GitHub repository.
  - Creates an Azure Key Vault.
- Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) to deploy the function app.
- GitHub Actions workflow to trigger the deployment.

```
---

## üîë Prerequisites
- Azure account & subscription
- GitHub account with personal access token (PAT) for repo creation
- Set the following **repository secrets**:
  - `GH_TOKEN`: GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope
  - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
  - `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
  - `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps
1. Commit and push your code.
2. Go to GitHub Actions tab.
3. Run the `Deploy Durable Functions Infra` workflow manually.
4. The workflow will:
   - Deploy the Azure Durable Function App.
   - Durable function will create GitHub repo and Key Vault at runtime.

## üß™ Test the Orchestrator
Trigger the Durable Functions orchestrator using the Azure Functions HTTP endpoint or Azure portal.

Use curl or Postman to send a POST request to the durable function:

``` curl -X POST https://<your-function-app>.azurewebsites.net/api/orchestrators/CreateRepoAndKeyVaultOrchestrator ```

If your durable orchestrator expects a payload like repo and key vault names, send a JSON payload too:

```
curl -X POST https://<your-function-app>.azurewebsites.net/api/orchestrators/CreateRepoAndKeyVaultOrchestrator \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"repo_name":"my-new-repo","keyvault_name":"myNewKeyvault"}'
```

## Check the status of the Orchestration

The POST request will give you back:
	‚Ä¢	a statusQueryGetUri
	‚Ä¢	a sendEventPostUri

Copy the statusQueryGetUri and hit it in a browser or with curl:

```
curl https://<your-function-app>.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/<your-instance-id>?code=<your-function-key>

```
This will show:
	‚Ä¢	"runtimeStatus": "Completed" once all tasks have run successfully.
	‚Ä¢	output will contain any output data.
 
‚úÖ 7Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Resources

After the status says Completed:
	1.	Go to your GitHub account ‚Äî verify that the new repository was created.
	2.	Go to your Azure Portal ‚Äî verify that the Key Vault resource exists.

If everything is present ‚úÖ then your setup worked!


---

## ‚úÖ Success
You will see:
- A new GitHub repo under your account.
- A new Key Vault in your Azure resource group.

## üß† Notes
- Durable Functions orchestrator and activity functions are implemented in PowerShell (`run.ps1` files).
- Adjust region, names, and any other variables in `infra/variables.tf`.
